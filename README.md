# Danborad Robot

## Brief

This time I’d like to share you a new project A Christmas Remote Control Robot named Danbo using Arduino. We use 2 Arduino UNOs for this project, one is for the robot side, and the other is for the remote controller side. We use a couple of wireless module for the communication. In our project, the robot can move his head and arms as well as waist.

Danbo (ダンボー) is a fictional cardboard box robot character from Kiyohiko Azuma's manga series Yotsuba&!. In the ADV Manga English translation of the manga the name Cardbo was used, but the name was restored to Danbo in the later released Yen Press English translation. In reality, Danbo is merely a person inside of a costume made of cardboard. Danbo was later picked up as an Internet meme, and inspired various electronic gadgets.
